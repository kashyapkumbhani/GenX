# Content Enhancement Plan: Dynamic Location-Based AI Content Generation

## Problem Statement
Currently, AI-generated content for location pages is too similar across different cities, leading to:
- Repetitive content patterns
- Poor SEO differentiation
- Lack of location-specific uniqueness
- Potential duplicate content issues

## Root Causes
1. **Generic Prompt Structure**: Prompts don't leverage location-specific details effectively
2. **AI Model Pattern Recognition**: Similar business types generate similar responses
3. **Insufficient Location Context**: Limited unique information per location
4. **Template-Based AI Thinking**: AI falls into repetitive content patterns

## Recommended Solution: Dynamic Prompt Modifiers + Location-Based Seed Generation

### Core Strategy
Implement an automated system that generates unique content variations for each location without manual intervention, scalable to 100+ locations.

### Key Components

#### 1. Dynamic Prompt Modifiers
- **Focus Angles**: Different service emphasis per location
- **Writing Styles**: Varied tone and approach
- **Stat Emphasis**: Different statistical focuses
- **Content Angles**: Location-specific positioning

#### 2. Location-Based Seed Generation
- Use city name hashing for consistent but unique assignments
- Ensure same location always gets same modifiers (consistency)
- Different locations get different combinations (uniqueness)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

#### **File: `modules/ai_content.py`**
**New Function**: `generate_location_modifiers(city_name)`
- Create arrays of content variation elements:
  ```
  focus_angles = [
    "speed & efficiency", 
    "quality & reliability", 
    "local expertise", 
    "customer satisfaction", 
    "professional service"
  ]
  
  writing_styles = [
    "professional tone", 
    "friendly approach", 
    "technical focus", 
    "community-centered", 
    "results-driven"
  ]
  
  stat_emphasis = [
    "satisfaction rates", 
    "project completion", 
    "response times", 
    "years of experience", 
    "customer retention"
  ]
  ```

**Hash-Based Assignment Logic**:
- Use `hash(city_name)` to generate consistent indices
- Assign different modifiers based on hash results
- Ensure reproducible results per location

#### **File: `modules/ai_content.py`**
**Modified Function**: `_generate_content_for_schema()`
- Integrate modifier generation before prompt construction
- Inject dynamic elements into AI prompts
- Replace static prompts with dynamic, location-specific versions

### Phase 2: Template Enhancement

#### **File: `templates/Greenz/location.json`**
**Enhanced AI Prompts**:
- Add placeholder variables: `{{ focus_angle }}`, `{{ writing_style }}`, `{{ stat_emphasis }}`
- Update existing `ai_prompt` fields to accept dynamic content
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing structure

**Example Enhancement**:
```json
"ai_prompt": "Generate content with {{ writing_style }} focusing on {{ focus_angle }} for {{ business.category }} services in {{ location.city }}. Emphasize {{ stat_emphasis }} in your response."
```

### Phase 3: Content Variation Implementation

#### **Modifier Categories**:

**Focus Angles** (5 variations):
1. Speed & Efficiency
2. Quality & Reliability  
3. Local Expertise
4. Customer Satisfaction
5. Professional Service

**Writing Styles** (5 variations):
1. Professional & Corporate
2. Friendly & Approachable
3. Technical & Detailed
4. Community-Centered
5. Results-Driven

**Stat Emphasis** (5 variations):
1. Customer Satisfaction Rates
2. Project Completion Volume
3. Response Time Metrics
4. Years of Experience
5. Customer Retention Rates

#### **Assignment Logic**:
```
city_hash = hash(city_name)
focus_index = city_hash % len(focus_angles)
style_index = (city_hash // 10) % len(writing_styles)
stat_index = (city_hash // 100) % len(stat_emphasis)
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

#### **Test Scenarios**:
1. Generate content for 5 different cities
2. Compare content similarity scores
3. Verify consistent assignment per location
4. Validate content quality and relevance

#### **Success Metrics**:
- Content similarity < 30% between locations
- Consistent modifiers per city across regenerations
- Maintained content quality and relevance
- SEO value preservation

## Expected Outcomes

### **Immediate Benefits**:
- Unique content for each of 100+ locations
- Zero manual intervention required
- Consistent quality across all locations
- Scalable to unlimited locations

### **SEO Benefits**:
- Reduced duplicate content risk
- Improved location-specific relevance
- Better search engine differentiation
- Enhanced local SEO performance

### **Long-term Advantages**:
- Automated content uniqueness
- Maintainable and scalable system
- Consistent brand voice with location variation
- Future-proof content generation

## Risk Mitigation

### **Potential Issues**:
1. **Content Quality Variation**: Some modifier combinations might produce lower quality
2. **Brand Consistency**: Too much variation might dilute brand message
3. **SEO Impact**: Dramatic changes might affect existing rankings

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Quality Control**: Test all modifier combinations before deployment
2. **Brand Guidelines**: Ensure all variations align with brand voice
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement for subset of locations first
4. **Monitoring**: Track content performance and SEO metrics
